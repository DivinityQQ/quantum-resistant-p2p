# Quantum Resistant P2P Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Quantum Resistant P2P application.

## Overview

This application provides a secure peer-to-peer communication platform using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to ensure security against quantum computer attacks.

## Key Features

- **Post-Quantum Security**: Uses algorithms resistant to quantum computing attacks
- **Secure Messaging**: End-to-end encrypted messaging
- **File Transfer**: Securely transfer files between peers
- **Key Management**: Advanced key management with automatic rotation
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use Qt-based interface

## Getting Started

- See the [User Guide](user-guide.md) for installation and usage instructions
- Review the [Architecture](architecture.md) for a high-level overview of the system
- Consult the [App Workflow (CZ)](Workflow.md) for detailed app usage examples
- See the [Testing Guide](testing-guide.md) for testing instructions
